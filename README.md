# Simple Random Sampling: A Comprehensive Analysis with R

## Project Overview

This repository contains a detailed report and R code for a comprehensive exploration of **Simple Random Sampling (SRS)**, one of the most fundamental probability sampling techniques in statistics. The project uses a hypothetical population of university students to demonstrate key concepts, from theoretical definitions to practical implementation and simulation.

The work includes a full methodological report, a reproducible R script for simulation, and a comparison of SRS With Replacement (SRSWR) and SRS Without Replacement (SRSWOR), highlighting their differences in efficiency and variance.

## Objectives

The primary objectives of this project are to:

1.  **Define** a clear population and sampling frame for a study.
2.  **Delineate** the exact, step-by-step procedure for selecting a sample via Simple Random Sampling.
3.  **Critically evaluate** the advantages and limitations of SRS in a practical context.
4.  **Explain** the conceptual and statistical differences between SRSWR and SRSWOR.
5.  **Simulate** both sampling methods in R to empirically demonstrate their properties and compare the results.
